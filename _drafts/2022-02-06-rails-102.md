## 6. Chomp!

I'll be honest. There's nothing ground-breaking about this one, it just has a cool name.

[Use it on a String](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/String.html#method-i-chomp){:target="_blank"} to either remove a new-line character from the end, or to remove a substring from the end.

```ruby
"Hello World\n".chomp
=> "Hello World"

"The sky is blue".chomp("blue")
=> "The sky is "
```

## 7. Console hacks!

The Rails console `rails c` (or the Interactive Ruby console) is a super helpful avenue for playing around with code in real-time or for investigating potential issues in an application. 

The console will output the returned value of the last statement.
Ocassionally this can be a nuisance if the last statement returned a lot of data (perhaps you're using a laggy SSH tunnel and don't want to scroll your terminal forever...), or perhaps it contains sensitive data which you don't need to see. 

```ruby
# Assigns all the Passwords into a variable, 
# BUT also outputs them to the console ðŸ˜•
sensitive = Password.all
=> #<Password id: 123, ...
```

By adding an additional (but pointless) statement, we can supress the unwanted console output. 

```ruby
# Assigns all the Passwords into a variable, 
# but only outputs the last statment ('nil')
sensitive = Password.all; nil 
=> nil
```

I use this all the time so I am only printing output to the console if I want to see it. When investigating complex issues, I often find myself scrolling back up my terminal to read a previous output again. This technique helps to reduce the amount of "noise" and scrolling required when working in the console.

Disclaimer: It should go without saying, `Password.all` is for demonstration purposes only. Please don't store passwords this way ðŸ˜‰

## 8. Show them you mean business! ðŸ’¥

Human nature is a strange thing. If at first you don't succeed .... try again more forcefully? 

In the world of mechanical engineering this concept is very scientifically referred to as a measure of [Ugga Duggas](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ugga%20dugga){:target="_blank"}. Bolt won't come loose? Did you try giving it three Ugga Duggas? 

Ruby has a convention where some methods are offered in two variants, `method` and `method!`, where those which end in `!` are typically a more forceful / dangerous / verbose variation of the original method. Often in Ruby itself, the dangerous methods are dangerous because they mutate the receiving object itself rather than returning the new outcome. 
But don't be fooled by those who claim this is always what happens; this rule does not persist in the murky waters of third-party libraries. Anything could happen! So [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM){:target="_blank"} ðŸ˜‰

Case in point: ActiveRecord interprets `!` methods something like ["Raise an error on failure, instead of returning false"](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-save){:target="_blank"}

```ruby
big_mac = MenuItem.new

big_mac.save
=> false  # But why? ðŸ¤”

big_mac.save!
=> ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: "Patron wasn't lovin' it"
```
